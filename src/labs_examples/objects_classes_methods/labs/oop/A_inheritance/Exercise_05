Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?
Parent called and Child called will be printed because the constructor of the parent class is called first and then the constructor of the child class is called.




public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
